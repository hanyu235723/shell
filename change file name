Write a shell script that renames all files in the current directory that end in ".jpg" to
begin with today's date in the following format: YYYY­MM­DD. For example, 
if a picture of my cat was in the current directory and today was October 31, 2016 
it would change name from "mycat.jpg" to "2016­10­31­mycat.jpg".


#!/bin/bash

# rename file *.mp3 in current directory 

function rename_file(){
        for file in *.jpg
do
        newname=$(date +%F)$(basename $file)
        echo $newname
 mv $file $newname
done


}

rename_file
